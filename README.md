ANALYSIS OF PART OF SPEECH TAGS IN LANGUAGE IDENTIFICATION OF CODE MIXED TEXT :

This project was made as a part of my Minor & Major Assignments during my course in B.Tech (Computer Science) in Jamia Millia Islamia University, New Delhi.
A research paper has also been published on it. Link - https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3462976

AIM - The project determines the part of speech (POS) of the words given in a sentence. The sentence can be either in English, Hindi or Hinglish (that is Hindi
written in English script).

APPROACH - 
For English only sentences, we took the sample data set alongwith the POS tags and trained our machine learning models.
For Hindi only sentences, we took the sample data set in Hindi script, trans-literated it into English and then trained our models with the dataset obtained.

TEACHNOLOGIES USED - 
NLTK library and Pandas in Python
